# Neighborhood Library
Welcome to my Neighborhood Library project application! 
The objective for this project is to showcase skills that were learned thus far by creating a free service, honor system-like application for a local library. 

In this application , you are first prompted with a welcome screen and a main menu with choices the user can select. 
To select a choice, you must select the number (or letter!) corresponding to the option desired. 
Please see screenshot section of this README for further details.


## Screenshots

In the screenshot below, you will see the welcome screen and desired choices.

In the screenshot below, you can see what the screen looks like when entering option 1. You are presented with a list of books that are currently available for "borrowing". Below that list, you are then presented with more options. There, you can enter the book ID number if you would like to borrow a book. Adversely, you can enter 0 to go back to the Main Menu.

In the screenshot below, let's see what happens when you want to select Book 19. Once the number is entered, you are then prompted to enter your name. If done correctly, you will get a success message and will be redirected back to the home page.

In the screennshot below, we are back at the main menu. What happens if you enter 2 this time? 
Here, you can see a list of checked out books and who may have it. Below the list, you can see further options to return to the home screen, or check in any of the books listed. Let's go ahead and check in/return the book borrowed.

In the screenshot below, you are followed by a series of prompts once again. Starting with the initial option, we will go ahead and enter "C". This will then prompt to enter the desired book you would like to return (which is book ID 19).  If done correctly you will be presented with a success message, followed by being redirected to the home screen.

As you can see, the application *should* run smoothly and straightforward. I do hope the screenshots and directions above are clear and concise. Please feel free to reach out to me if any questions or feedback may arise!
